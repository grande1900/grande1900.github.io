<h1>Morphosyntactic Alignment</h1>
In linguistics, <b>Morphosyntactic Alignment</b> is the system used to distinguish between the arguments of transitive verbs, and those of intransitive verbs. The distinction can be made morphologically (through grammatical case or verbal agreement), syntactically (through word order), or through both.

<h2>Semantics and grammatical relations</h2>
The difference between transitive and intransitive verbs lies in the amount of core arguments they have. A <b>Transitive</b> verb takes both an Agent <b>A</b> and Object <b>O</b>, while an <b>Intransitive</b> one only takes a Subject <b>S</b>.

The alignment can take several different forms:
	<ul>
<li><b>Nominative&ndash;accusative</b> languages treat the Agent and Subject the same while separating the Object. (<span class="Green">A</span>=<span class="Green">S</span>, <span class="Red">O</span>) The cases of Subject and Agent are Nominative, while the Object is Accusative, as occurs with the Nominative <i>-us</i> and the Accusative <i>-um</i> in Latin: <i>Juli<span class="Green">us</span> venit</i> "Julius came"; <i>Juli<span class="Green">us</span> Brut<span class="Red">um</span> vidit</i> "Julius saw Brutus". English is also a nominative-accusative language, as in <i><span class="Green">I</span> saw <span class="Red">him</span>, <span class="Green">He</span> saw <span class="Red">me</span>.</i></li>
<li><b>Ergative&ndash;absolutive</b> languages treat the Subject and Object as the same, while separating the Agent. (<span class="Green">S</span>=<span class="Green">O</span>, <span class="Red">A</span>) The agent is marked with Ergative case while subject and object take Absolutive. Ergative&ndash;absolutive languages can detransitivize transitive verbs by demoting the Object and promoting the Agent to a Subject, thus taking the Absolutive case; this is called the Antipassive voice.</li>
<li><b>Transitive</b> languages treat the Agent and Object the same while separating the Subject. (<span class="Green">A</span>=<span class="Green">O</span>, <span class="Red">S</span>) the Subject takes the Intransitive case, while the agent and object take the Transitive case.</li>
<li><b>Direct</b> languages treat the Agent, Object and Subject all the same, (<span class="Green">S</span>=<span class="Green">O</span>=<span class="Green">A</span>) and hence mark none of them.</li>
<li><b>Tripartite</b> languages treat Subject, Object, and Agent separately. (<span class="Red">S</span>, <span class="Red">O</span>, <span class="Red">A</span>)</li>
<li><b>Fluid</b> languages treats some verbs as <b>Nominative&ndash;accusative</b>, while treating others as <b>Ergative&ndash;absolutive</b>.</li>
	</ul>
