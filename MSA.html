<h1>Morphosyntactic Alignment</h1>
In linguistics, morphosyntactic alignment is the system used to distinguish between the arguments of transitive verbs and those of intransitive verbs. The distinction can be made morphologically (through grammatical case or verbal agreement), syntactically (through word order), or both.

<h2>Semantics and grammatical relations</h2>
The difference between transitive and intransitive verbs lies in the amount of core arguments they have. A Transitive verb takes both subject (in transitive cases they are called agents (A) and will be hence forth) and object (O) while the Intransitive one only takes subject (S).

The alignment can take several different forms:
	<ul>
<li><b>Nominative–accusative alignment</b> languages treat the agent and subject the same while leaving object alone (<span class="IT">A</span>=<span class="IT">S</span>, <span class="TR">O</span>). The S and A case is called Nominative while O have Accusative case as occurs with nominative ''-us'' and accusative ''-um'' in Latin: ''Juli<span class="IT">us</span> venit'' "Julius came"; ''Juli<span class="IT">us</span> Brut<span class="TR">um</span> vidit'' "Julius saw Brutus". English is also a nominative-accusative language, <span class="IT">I</span> saw <span class="TR">him</span>, <span class="IT">He</span> saw <span class="TR">me</span></li>
<li><b>Ergative–absolutive</b> languages treat the subject and object the same while leaving the agent alone (<span class="IT">S</span>=<span class="IT">O</span>, <span class="TR">A</span>). The agent is marked with Ergative case while subject and object take Absolutive. Ergative–absolutive languages can detransitivize transitive verbs by demoting the O and promoting the A to an S, thus taking the absolutive case; this is called the antipassive voice.</li>
<li><b>Transitive</b> languages treat the agent and object the same while leaving the subject alone (<span class="IT">A</span>=<span class="IT">O</span>, <span class="TR">S</span>). Subject takes Intransitive case while agent and object take the Transitive case.</li>
<li><b>Direct</b> languages treat the agent, object and subject all the same (<span class="IT">S</span>=<span class="IT">O</span>=<span class="IT">A</span>) and hence mark none of them.</li>
<li><b>Tripartite</b> languages treat subject, object, agent all seperately (<span class="TR">S</span>, <span class="TR">O</span>, <span class="TR">A</span>).</li>
<li><b>Fluid</b>languages treats some verbs as <b>Nominative–accusative</b>, while treating others as <b>Ergative–absolutive</b>.</li>
	</ul>
